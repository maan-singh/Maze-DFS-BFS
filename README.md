# Maze-DFS-BFS
Console Java application that automatically generates and solve mazes. Each time the program is run, it will generate and print a new random maze and the solution. To solve the maze, depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms are used. The program is supported by JUnit testing.
